[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is an online subscription learning platform with a focusing on data science teaching programming languages R, SQL, and Python. Below are the projects I completed working through real-world problems testing my knowledge of R and SQL.

If you find these projects helpful for you to learn data analysis please leave a star to help others in the future.
